# implant-audio
 
Python script and lua client that stream your microphone audio to a Plethora neural implant, pocket computer, or even a regular computer, as long as it has a speaker attached, then plays it.

Made it as a quick-and-dirty thing for myself, to do it yourself you will have to modify some settings, specifically the `p.open` settings. Look in your computer's settings and find what different options your microphone supports.

Client is barebones and unfinished, currently anyway. Just use austream. Also, edit lines 27 and 33 too.
